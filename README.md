### What I Do

I'm currently a Computer Science student at IIT Ropar, deeply passionate about software development, AI/ML, and building impactful, real-world projects.
Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time exploring AI agents and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. AI fascinates me, and I'm always eager to create tools that blend intelligence with utility.

### My Favourite Creation

[ProjectName](https://link-to-project.com)  
*AURA* is an Autonomous RAG for financial analysis. A novel, multi-agentic framework specifically designed for financial question and answer (Q&A) tasks. The framework leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) and incorporates a human-in-the-loop approach, leading to more accurate and adaptable results.  
> I made this project in collaboration with [Alankrit Kadian](https://github.com/alankritkadian) [Devanshu Dhawan](https://github.com/TheProBro) and Yugam Bhatt for Inter IIT Tech Meet 13.0, IIT Bombay.
